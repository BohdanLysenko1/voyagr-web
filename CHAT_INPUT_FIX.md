# Chat Input Box Position Fix

## Problem
The text input box in the chat window was moving and jumping as the user scrolled the page, caused by:
1. Dynamic `transform` CSS being applied based on keyboard state
2. Keyboard offset tracking causing position changes
3. Complex mobile-specific code with conflicting logic
4. Unused imports and state adding unnecessary complexity

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Keyboard Logic
- **Removed** `subscribeToKeyboardState` and keyboard detection imports
- **Removed** `keyboardState` state management
- **Removed** `composerHeight` tracking via ResizeObserver
- **Removed** iOS device detection that was no longer needed
- **Removed** dynamic `transform: translateY()` styles

### 2. Simplified Positioning
- Changed from transform-based positioning to simple padding-based layout
- Input wrapper now uses fixed padding instead of dynamic transforms:
  - Mobile: `calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom) + 80px)` bottom padding
  - Desktop: `calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom) + 24px)` bottom padding
- No more `willChange` or position changes during scroll

### 3. Cleaned Up Scroll Logic
- Simplified `isNearBottom` to use direct calculation instead of external utility
- Removed mobile-specific scroll timing complexity
- Streamlined auto-scroll effects
- Removed dependency on `scrollNode` state

### 4. Removed Unused Code
- Removed iOS-specific button tap preventDefault/stopPropagation
- Cleaned up unused state variables and refs
- Removed complex keyboard offset calculations

### 5. CSS Updates
- Removed redundant z-index and position rules for `.glass-input` on mobile
- Kept essential scroll optimizations for smooth performance

## Technical Benefits
1. **Stable positioning** - Input stays in same place regardless of scroll position
2. **Better performance** - No transform recalculations on scroll
3. **Cleaner code** - Removed ~100 lines of problematic keyboard detection
4. **More maintainable** - Simpler logic is easier to debug and modify
5. **Best practices** - Uses CSS padding/margin instead of transforms for layout

## Files Modified
- `/src/components/AI/AIInterface.tsx` - Main refactoring
- `/src/app/globals.css` - Removed conflicting mobile styles

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test scrolling chat on desktop - input should remain stationary
2. Test scrolling chat on mobile - input should remain stationary
3. Test with keyboard open on mobile - input should stay visible
4. Verify no jumping when sending messages
5. Check that auto-scroll still works correctly
